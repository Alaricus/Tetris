# Tetris

I often play games and sometimes work on little games of my own. Recently I wrote [SimpleTetris](https://alaricus.github.io/SimpleTetris/) as a personal challenge (was trying to fit it into 100 lines of code) and my girlfriend, who doesn't much care for gaming, actually wanted to play it. In an effort to make the game less minimalistic and more enjoyable for her, I added more features and made it look more like traditional Tetris.

You can [try it](https://alaricus.github.io/Tetris/) out as well. =)
