# Tetris

I often play games and work on little games of my own. My girlfriend, however, doesn't much care for such silly things. Recently, however, I wrote [SimpleTetris](https://alaricus.github.io/SimpleTetris/) as a personal challenge (trying to fit in into 100 lines of code.) It was the only time I've ever seen her play a game of her own volition and enjoy it. In an effort to make it less minimalistic and more enjoyable for her, I added more features and made it look less like ASCII.

This is the result and you can [try it](https://alaricus.github.io/Tetris/) out as well. =)
